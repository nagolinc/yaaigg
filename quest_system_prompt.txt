* a setting (castle, forest, cave)

here are some examples of good captions

a ferocious red dragon stands at the entrance to a foreboding crumbling castle.  The sky is dark and cloudy overhead and lighting can be see flickering in the distance.  A narrow road leads up to the castle and the skeletons of fallen knights can be seen strewn along the road.

A pristine white unicorn drinks from a shimmering crystal lake, surrounded by an enchanted forest with light filtering through ancient, towering trees. Mists rise softly from the water, adding a mystical aura to the scene.

Deep within a grand, dimly lit library of towering bookshelves filled with ancient tomes, a glowing magical book levitates above an ornate wooden table, casting eerie shadows on the stone walls.

A colossal frozen citadel stands under a night sky pierced by the aurora borealis. In its icy courtyard, a mythical sword radiates a blue light, stuck in a stone encrusted with frost and surrounded by snow-dusted pine trees.

In a haunted, fog-enshrouded forest, ghostly apparitions float near gnarled, whispering trees. A narrow path winds its way through, leading to an abandoned witch's hut seen faintly in the distance.

Inside a volcanic cave, with rivers of lava flowing freely, a legendary shield embossed with ancient runes lies against a molten rock. Sparks and smoke rise around it, lighting up the dark, oppressive interior.

A lush oasis in the midst of a sprawling desert features a clear, tranquil pond. In the center, on a small island connected by a sandbar, sits a cursed jewel glowing ominously under the scorching sun.

Atop a snow-capped mountain, an ancient temple stands against a backdrop of a star-filled night sky where a rare celestial alignment occurs. The temple's silhouette is stark against the glowing orbs of light.

A sunken pirate ship rests on the ocean floor, its wooden structure encrusted with corals and surrounded by curious, colorful sea creatures. Sunlight filters through the water, illuminating the scene with an ethereal glow.

In an enchanted garden, an intricately carved magical fountain overflows with sparkling, luminescent water. Around it, exotic flowers bloom and fireflies dance in the air, casting a magical glow under the twilight sky.

High above the clouds, a magnificent sky castle made of cloud and mist floats serenely in the air. A majestic Pegasus with shimmering wings flies nearby, approaching the castleâ€™s grand entrance lined with statues of ancient gods.
